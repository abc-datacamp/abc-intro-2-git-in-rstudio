## Version control in RStudio IDE

Git is a particular implementation of a version control system.  A version control system is a software tool which manages and keeps track of changes to source code over time.  Some of its chief benefits include:

- Ability to revert back to older versions of your code
- Ability to view the differences between two versions of your code
- Ability to review the history of your code
- Ability to determine when a bug was introduced
- Ability to experiment with new features without worrying

RStudio implements support for two version control systems: Git and Subversion.  We will focus on Git.

Whenever you want Git to track set of code, you have to create a *repository*.  A repository is simply the place were Git tracks your code over time.
In RStudio, you can easily add a git repository to an existing project.
